#! Think of an idea
# Who do you want to build something for? Yourself? Your friends? Your family? Your co-workers?
# I want to build it for myself and my friends to play

# What are your/their hobbies?
# To create more fun games

# Do you want to build something more fun or something more useful?
# Yes, I will definitely try my best to develop such a thing that's bring joy to everyone

#! Project Brainstorming
# What does your program do?
# Challenge the player to allocate all the bombs on the map and win

#* How will it work in a terminal?
#? Step 1: Print out the board
#? Step 2: let the player press the index
#? Step 3: if boom ? kaboom : continue
#? Step 4: if out_of_boom ? win : continue
#? Step 5: Print out the Victory Screen

# Is it one player or two players?
# One Player Game
